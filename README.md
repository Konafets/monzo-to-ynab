# Privacy

This system will only register a webhook, then send any new transactions to the specified YNAB account.

It will _not_:
- View, log, or store your balance
- View, log, or store your transactions
- View, log or store your pots
- View, log, or store your feed items
- View, log, or store attachments (receipts generally)

# TODO

- Request email address to notify if we fail to sync (OAuth token failure/revocation)
- Update README with self setup instructions
